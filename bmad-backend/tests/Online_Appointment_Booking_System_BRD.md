## 2. Executive Summary
HealthyCare Clinic seeks to implement an Online Appointment Booking System (OABS) to allow patients to schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments online, reduce call volume, improve patient satisfaction, and optimize clinician utilization. This project will deliver a secure, user-friendly web and mobile-responsive system integrated with the clinicâ€™s existing EHR scheduling module.

## 3. Business Objectives
- Reduce front-desk phone calls related to appointment scheduling by 40% within 6 months of launch.
- Increase appointment booking outside office hours (after-hours/self-service) to 25% of total bookings.
- Reduce no-show rate by 15% through automated reminders and confirmations.
- Improve patient satisfaction scores related to scheduling from 3.8 to 4.5 (out of 5) within 12 months.

## 4. Scope
### 4.1 In Scope
- Patient self-service web portal and mobile-responsive UI for appointment booking, rescheduling, and cancellation.
- Real-time integration with EHR scheduling API (read/write of appointment slots).
- Automated SMS and email reminders and confirmations.
- Eligibility checks for insurance-specific appointment rules.
- Admin dashboard for staff to manage settings, view analytics, and override bookings.

### 4.2 Out of Scope
- Telehealth video conferencing (separate project).
- Full EHR migration or changes to clinician workflows beyond scheduling.
- Billing/payment processing during booking (future phase).

## 5. Stakeholders
- Project Sponsor: Director of Operations, HealthyCare Clinic
- Product Owner: Clinic Manager
- Technical Lead: IT Manager / EHR Integration Lead
- Front Desk Staff Representatives
- Patients / Patient Advisory Group
- Compliance & Privacy Officer

## 6. User Personas
- **Patient** â€” Sarah, 34, books appointments on mobile, expects quick flow and reminders.
- **Front Desk Staff** â€” Omar, manages manual overrides, waits for synchronization with EHR.
- **Clinician** â€” Dr. Lee, needs accurate schedule and minimal double-booking.
- **Admin** â€” Priya, configures appointment types, rules, and review analytics.

## 7. Functional Requirements
Note: Each requirement is labeled FR-{number}.

**FR-01** â€” User authentication and patient verification  
- Patients can create an account or authenticate using phone/email.  
- System validates patient identity against EHR using patient ID or matching demographics.

**FR-02** â€” Search and display available appointment slots  
- Patients can search by provider, specialty, service, or location.  
- The system shows real-time available slots pulled from the EHR.

**FR-03** â€” Book, reschedule, and cancel appointments  
- Patients can book an available slot; on confirmation, the appointment is created in EHR.  
- Rescheduling updates the EHR; cancellations free the slot per cancellation policy.

**FR-04** â€” Automated reminders and confirmations  
- System sends SMS and email confirmations upon booking and reminders 72h and 24h before appointment.

**FR-05** â€” Administrative dashboard  
- Staff can view bookings, override or block slots, configure rules, and run reports.

**FR-06** â€” Business rules enforcement  
- Enforce provider-specific rules (e.g., minimum notice, maximum daily bookings), insurance restrictions, and appointment durations.

**FR-07** â€” Audit logging and reporting  
- All scheduling actions are logged for audit and reconciliation; weekly analytics available.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- **NFR-01** â€” Availability: 99.5% uptime (excluding scheduled maintenance).
- **NFR-02** â€” Performance: Search results load within 2 seconds, booking flow complete within 5 seconds end-to-end.
- **NFR-03** â€” Security: HIPAA-compliant data handling, TLS 1.2+ in transit, encrypted at rest.
- **NFR-04** â€” Scalability: Support up to 10,000 users per day with load spikes.
- **NFR-05** â€” Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.

## 9. Data Requirements
- Patient profile: name, DOB, contact (email/phone), patient ID, insurance info.
- Appointment data: appointment ID, provider ID, start/end, status, source (web/staff).
- Audit logs: timestamp, user/system actor, action type, prior state.

## 10. Assumptions
- EHR exposes an API for real-time schedule read/write.
- Patients have access to email or mobile phone for verification and reminders.
- Clinic staff will receive basic training prior to launch.

## 11. Constraints
- Must comply with HIPAA and local data residency laws.
- Integration limited to current EHR API capabilities.
- Budget and timeline constraints (see timeline).

## 12. Dependencies
- EHR vendor cooperation and API access.
- SMS/email provider integration (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid).
- IT infrastructure for hosting or cloud services.

## 13. Acceptance Criteria
- **AC-01** â€” End-to-end booking flow verified with 95% success rate in test scenarios.
- **AC-02** â€” Successful creation and visibility of appointments in EHR during integration tests.
- **AC-03** â€” Reminder messages sent and received in staging with correct content and timing.
- **AC-04** â€” Security penetration testing completed with no high-severity findings.

## 14. Success Metrics
- 40% reduction in scheduling phone calls within 6 months.
- 25% of appointments booked outside business hours within 6 months.
- 15% reduction in no-shows within 12 months.

## 15. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: EHR API rate limits cause sync issues.  
  **Mitigation**: Implement queueing/backoff and retry logic; batch sync where possible.

- **Risk**: Low patient adoption.  
  **Mitigation**: Launch patient communications campaign and front-desk promotion.

- **Risk**: Data privacy breach.  
  **Mitigation**: Engage security experts, perform encryption, audits, and least-privilege access.

## 16. Implementation Approach & Timeline (High Level)
- **Phase 0** â€” Discovery & Requirements Refinement: 2 weeks  
- **Phase 1** â€” Design & Prototyping: 4 weeks  
- **Phase 2** â€” Development & Integration: 8â€“10 weeks  
- **Phase 3** â€” Testing (Integration, UAT, Security): 4 weeks  
- **Phase 4** â€” Pilot Rollout (one location): 4 weeks  
- **Phase 5** â€” Full Rollout & Monitoring: 6â€“8 weeks  
- **Total estimated timeline**: ~6 months (subject to integrations).
