Always when trying to run a backend or frontend server, ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up correctly. Always change the directory to correct place.
For back end always use virtual environment.
Never change the original files to fit the tests. If the tests cannot fit, ask the user to change the main files.
If you do any changes to the front end, check the tests, and make sure they still work.
